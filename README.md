# babe-smash

![Live app](./readme_imgs/readme/live.png)   

This was inspired by the scene from the movie Social Network in which Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg creates Face-smash.

Eduardo Saverin, then a friend of Zuckerberg, writes an Elo rating algorithm on the window of a Havard dorm.

The algorithm in the film is actually incorrect - it should be:  
Ea = 1/(1+10((Rb-Ra)/400))   
Eb = 1/(1+10((Ra-Rb)/400))  

Here is my ealier JavaScript code for Facesmash: <a href="https://github.com/k1n4kut4/facesmash">https://github.com/k1n4kut4/facesmash</a>
